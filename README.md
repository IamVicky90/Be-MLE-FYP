## Overview
Machine Learning process is tiresome process where you get a decent dataset, preprocess it, deal with null values, standardize or normalize the data then pick a decent model to
train it. Be MLE (Become a Machine Learning) is a system that automates the process a normal
machine learning engineer goes through in his/her job.

## Motivation
With the growing scope of Machine Learning and Deep Learning, it is a must in most of the applications we use. From recommendation systems to smart searches, from prediction systems to computer vision AI and ML is being used in most of the software's we interact with in our daily life. Our system is supposed to help all those developers around the globe that need an AI module in their system but donâ€™t have any/little bit knowledge of machine learning. With our system everyone will become a machine learning engineer.
## Purpose
Machine Learning is a blooming discipline of the present times. Almost every application or system we use have involvement of AI one way or another. From recommender systems to weather predictions machine learning is an essential part of new systems being developed. BeMLE makes it easy for a software developer to get the AI part of the app done with easy. The system takes data and trains a bunch of models on its own and provides with the best model. This way the software developer need not to know anything about the working of machine learning, which model to choose, what hyperparameters to set or how to maximize the accuracy. With BeMLE developers will get trained models on provided data.

## BeMLE Architecture Design
High Level Architecture Design.

## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into five part:
1. Processing Data, Analyzing, Training, Storing, using different Machine Learning And Deep Learning(Neaural Networks) Techniques.
2. Building deployed, and hosting a Flask web app on Amazon Web Services(AWS)( http://35.194.69.17:5000/ ). And also Deploying on Kubernatives.
3. Microservice Level Architecture.
4. [CircleCI](#continous-integrations) for continous integration
5. [ArgoCD](#continous-deployments) for continous Deployment

## Admin Portal
To see logs of the apps we aso create an admin portal so that we keep records of the steps taken by the user or system and is used to detect error so the admins will know where and in which project module/microservice/line the system faces errors. In short Admins, can check Loggings to see system status at each point of time. It helps for the admin to detect problems and eventually to solve them.

## Continous Integrations
For contiouns Integration we use CircleCI pipelines
#### CircleCI Responsibilities
1. Unit Testing, for this I use pytest
2. If all test pass then it will create docker containers of all the microservices.
3. After creating, it will push all these containers to DockerHub.
4. Deply these applications to ec2 instance (by pulling these containers from dockerhub, and setting their environment variables via script).
#### CircleCI builds
<img width="960" alt="circleci" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62692329/216989836-809c31da-98ba-408b-b9c9-25548239d1ae.png">

## Continous Deployments
For continous deployment, we use ArgoCD.
#### ArgoCD Responsibilities
1. Monitors progress and when the Kubernetes cluster is ready, reports that the application is in sync.
2. Continously see the repo after every 3 minutes and deploy the changes if there is any.
3. Change the pod deployment in kubernatives if we change the version in k8 branch of GitHub.
#### ArgoCD

###### Follow the following commands for project setup with k8's cluster.
- To start the minikube with docker
    ```bash
    minikube start --driver=docker
    ```
- To point your shell to minikube's docker-daemon
    ```bash
    eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env)
    ```
- Apply the secrets for the cluster.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f kubernates/microservices/mongo-secret.yaml
    ```
- To confirm/see the secrets.
    ```bash
    kubectl get secrets
    ```
- Apply the configmap for the cluster.
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f kubernates/microservices/mongo-configmap.yaml
    ```
- To confirm/see the configmaps.
    ```bash
    kubectl get configmap
    ```
- Apply the Deployment snd Service for mongo.yaml
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f kubernates/microservices/mongo.yaml
    ```

    ```
- To get the external IP for bemle-service
    ```bash
    minikube service bemle-service 
    ```
## Kubernatives Cloud Setup
(Recommended)
For cloud setup you must have [awscli2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), [kubectl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/install-kubectl.html) and [eksctl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/eksctl.html)
- Create eksctl cluster from the following command
```bash
eksctl create cluster --name [any name] --region [enter region]  --version 1.22 --nodegroup-name [specify your name] --node-type [specify node name] --nodes [enter number of nodes]
```
Apply Following commands
- Run Microservices but must change the environment variables from secrets and configmaps
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernates/microservices/
```
- To Run efs for volume persistance

Note: must change the server link of efs in efs/deployment.yaml file
```
kubectl apply -f kubernates/efs/
```
- Run mongodb cluster
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernates/mongodb_k8s_configrations
```
- To expose the mongo link to third party app outside the kubernatives cluster
```bash
kubectl expose pod mongo-deployment-0  --port 11392 --target-port 27017 --type LoadBalancer
kubectl expose pod mongo-deployment-1  --port 11392 --target-port 27017 --type LoadBalancer
kubectl expose pod mongo-deployment-2  --port 11392 --target-port 27017 --type LoadBalancer
```
- Apply ArgoCD 

To apply ArgoCD you first need to install it by following commands
```bash
# install ArgoCD in k8s
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml

# access ArgoCD UI
kubectl get svc -n argocd
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server 8080:443 -n argocd

# login with admin user and below token (as in documentation):
kubectl -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 --decode && echo

```
- Change source and destination in kubernates/argocd-application.yaml file and apply it by following command
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernates/argocd-application.yaml
```
- Apply BeMLE ML API microservice

Note: You must change ML_API_HOSTNAME_WITH_PORT in kubernates/bemle_ml_api_configmap.yaml file and apply it by following command
```bash
kubectl apply -f kubernates/bemle_ml_api_configmap.yaml
```
